# TOP-Members Only

Implement PassaportJs Local Strategy for authentication and only allow club members to see the names
of the posted messages author's.

### About

In this app you can sign-up to be able to publish messages, otherwise you can only see whats posted.

If you sign-up there's and option to join the club but will need a secret code to get in and be able to
see who posted what.

The design of the site combines some images of cuban colored walls with a simple, clear choice of font,
stylings and colors for all the elements.
